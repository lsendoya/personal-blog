		<div class="biography">
			<p>
				I'm Luis Hernando Sendoya and I'm a software developer, I have
				an innate passion for technology and programming. My year-long
				experience in the field has allowed me to develop solid skills
				in programming languages such as Typescript and GO. In addition,
				I also have experience in web application development, as well
				as database design and migration.
			</p>
			<p>
				But I am not only focused on my own development; I am also
				committed to the success of the company and my teammates. I
				consider myself a collaborative team player and am always
				willing to work together to achieve the company's goals. I
				believe in the importance of effective communication and
				collaboration to achieve successful projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, as a software developer, I offer a unique combination
				of strong technical skills, a continuous learning approach, and
				a collaborative attitude to working as a team player. I am
				excited to continue to grow professionally and be part of an
				innovative and results-oriented team.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my internship at ZULU TECH, I had the opportunity to
				demonstrate my skills as a fullstack developer. During my time
				at the company, I led important initiatives such as the creation
				of REST APIs in NodeJS and NestJs, the implementation of
				microservices in GO, and the creation of unit tests for both
				JavaScript and GO. I also participated in the creation of SQL
				and NoSQL databases, and contributed in the implementation of
				components and pages with React and NextJS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to my experience in these areas, I was able to have a
				complete view of the modern web application development process.
				I am sure that my technical skills and my ability to work in a
				team would be a great contribution to any project I get involved
				in.
